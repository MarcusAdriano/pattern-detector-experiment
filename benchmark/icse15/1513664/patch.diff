+ * A simple class that can keep track of a running average of a series of numbers. One can add to or remove
  * from the series, as well as update a datum in the series. The class does not actually keep track of the
  * series of values, just its running average, so it doesn't even matter if you remove/change a value that
  * wasn't added.
