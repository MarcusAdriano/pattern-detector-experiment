  * <P>
- * Note: currenly dates before 1970 cannot be used, and therefore cannot be

+ * Note that you do not have to use this class, you can just save your
+ * dates as strings if lexicographic sorting orders them by date. This is
+ * the case for example for dates like <code>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss</code>
+ * (of course you can leave out the delimiter characters to save some space).
+ * The advantage with using such a format is that you can easily save dates
+ * with the required granularity, e.g. leaving out seconds. This saves memory
+ * when searching with a RangeQuery or PrefixQuery, as Lucene
+ * expands these queries to a BooleanQuery with potentially very many terms.
